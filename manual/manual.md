## Section 4. Perform Image Classification for Project **Labor Market Analysis**

> Requirement: ***A machine with a compatible NVIDIA GPU device available & tensorflow-gpu lib. for Python available***

For labor market analysis, one of the objectives is to provide **gender-related analysis**. For **Freelancer** dataset, however, the gender information for each job seeker is not revealed. Therefore, a **TensorFlow-based Machine Learning model** for **image classification** is proposed. The profile pictures of job seekers on Freelancer were already collected within the dataset.

<u>***Procedure***</u>

1. Scraping Profile Pictures:

    To prepare for downloading the profile images, in the extracted folder of the given `requirements_image.zip`, a folder named `Dataset` contains the pre-scraped Freelancer dataset that holds the links to all the profile pictures. Follows:

    a. Copy the file `freelancer_supply_20190204.csv` into the path:
    ```bash
    C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\UN_Research_Image_Classification_for_Gender-master\labor_market\gender_classification\downloading
    # Change <user_name> to the computer username.
    ```

    b. Open a **Windows Powershell**, then:
    ```bash
    $ cd 'C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\UN_Research_Image_Classification_for_Gender-master\labor_market\gender_classification\downloading'
    # Change <user_name> to the computer username. Then, run the program:
    $ python run.py -u 1
    ```

    c. The program will prompt to ask for inputing the exact filename of the Freelancer dataset file. Type the following then hit `Enter`:
    ```bash
    ./freelancer_supply_20190204.csv
    ```

2. Performing Image Classification:

    a. Create **1** folder named `imgs` under path:
    ```bash
    C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\UN_Research_Image_Classification_for_Gender-master\labor_market\gender_classification\
    # Change <user_name> to the computer username.
    ```
    
    b. Place the images which to be classified into that newly created folder.

    c. Under extracted folder of `requirements_image.zip`, the folder `Dataset` contains a folder `training_imgs`. Copy that folder into the same path given above. The folder `training_imgs` has 3 sub-folders, **female**, **male**, and **unknown**. Each of the sub-folders contains nearly ***1000*** pre-classified images. Those images are the training dataset for machine learning model training.

    d. Open a **Windows Powershell**, navigate to the program folder by:
    ```bash
    $ cd C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\UN_Research_Image_Classification_for_Gender-master\labor_market\gender_classification\classifying
    # Change <user_name> to the computer username.
    ```

    e. Perform model retraining:
    ```bash
    $ python retrain.py --img_dir=../training_imgs
    # Wait until the process complete.
    ```

    f. Finally, perform classification on the target images:
    ```bash
    $ python label_image.py --graph=/tmp/output_graph.pb --labels=/tmp/output_labels.txt \
        --input_layer=Placeholder --output_layer=final_result \
        --start 0 --concurrent 1000 --partition 1000 \
        --img_dir=../imgs/ \
        --data_file=*.jpg \
    # Wait until the process complete.
    ```
